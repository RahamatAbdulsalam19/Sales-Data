Introduction

The dataset titled "Sales Data" from Kaggle contains sales records from various products, countries, and sales channels. It provides a comprehensive overview of sales performance, including metrics like quantity sold, prices, sales, and profits. The purpose of this review is to analyze the dataset using Power BI to identify key insights and suggest potential areas for further analysis.

Observation

Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of the following columns:
- Date: The date of the sales transaction.
- Product: The name of the product sold.

Initial Insights

1. Total Sales by Product, by Location:
   Using Power BI, a pie chart was created to visualize the distribution of sales across different products. This helps in identifying the top-performing products in terms of total sales.


2. Sales, Price, and Quantity Analysis:
   Summary statistics for total sales, total price, and total quantity were generated to provide a quick snapshot of the dataset's financial aspects. Power BI's table visualization was used to display these statistics.

3. Monthly Sales Trend:
   A column chart in Power BI was used to plot the sales trend over time, which helps in identifying seasonal patterns or growth trends.
